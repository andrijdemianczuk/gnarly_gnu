## Description
One of the top considerations for commercial airline travel is customer
experience, and with regards to customer experience baggage processing
is top-of-mind. Having a low-cost, reliable experience of travel can be a deciding
factor when choosing which carrier to travel with. In this demo project, we will examine
how to best track and understand what's happening during the baggage handling process at
a given airport.

## Databricks Connect  
DBConnect v2 was used in the development of some parts of this project. To get a quick overview
of how this was set up on PyCharm, the documentation can be found [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-connect/python/index.html).
The [Databricks SDK](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-python.html) is also extensively used.
